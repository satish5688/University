Step 1:
    Execute the following queries in your Snowflake UI:
    CREATE DATABASE UNIVERSITY;
    CREATE SCHEMA UNIVERSITY.SCHOLARSHIP_INFO;

Step 2:
    Download and place the json files shared in a folder named “query_dataset”.
    Download and place the “university_data.xlsx” in a location.

Step 3:
    Create a config file named “config.cfg” that will store only your Snowflake credentials like below:

    [SNOWFLAKE]
    account=”xxxxxxx”
    user=”xxxxx”
    password=”xxxxxxx”
    …other relevant information

Step 4:
    Create a python program (main.py) that will do the following:
    1.	Take input of the following parameters:
    a.	Function Type: -t as “create”
    b.	Config File Path: -c as “<Complete path of your config file location>”
    c.	Folder of JSON file: -d as “<Folder Path of the json files>”
    2.	Read the json files from the folder and create tables in Snowflake (table name should be the same as json file name)

Step 5:
    Extend the program (main.py) that will do the following:
    1.	Take input of the following parameters:
    a.	Function Type: -t as “insert”
    b.	Config File Path: -c as “<Complete path of your config file location>”
    c.	Path of university_data excel: -d as “<File path of university_data.xlsx>”
    2.	Read the excel file and check the sheet name at bottom and create a dynamic insert query from the data in the sheet and insert it into the same table as the sheet name.


Step 6:
    Extend the program (main.py) that will do the following:
    1.	Take input of the following parameters:
        a.	Function Type: -t as “fetch
        b.	Config File Path: -c as ““<Complete path of your config file location>”
        c.	Output File Path: -d as “Desired path of output text file”
    2.	Create a python function that will take 2 inputs “total_student_marks”  and “college_type” and will return flag ‘TRUE’ or ‘FALSE’ based on the below criteria:
    a.	Calculate percentage based on the following:
    If college_type == “Medicine” then total_subject_marks = 500
    If college_type == “Engineering” then total_subject_marks = 1000
    If college_type == “Science” then total_subject_marks = 700
    If college_type == “Humanities” then total_subject_marks = 400

    Percentage logic: (total_student_marks/total_subject_marks)* 100

    b.	Update the student table PERCENTAGE = <data from Python function> and SCHOLARSHIP_STATUS to TRUE for those students whose percentage is greater than 90%.
    c.	Generate a TEXT report that will contain the answer to the following questions:

        1.	Student Name, Stream, College Name of the University Topper (Student with Highest Percentage irrespective of college)
        2.	Student Name, Stream, College Name for the topper of all the colleges (Student with Highest Percentage from each college)
        3.	Student Name, Stream, College Name for the topper of each subject for each college.
        4.	Rank of Colleges based on the average of percentages of the students.
        5.	Rank of all students for each college for each stream.
        6.	Student Name, Stream, College Name for all students who have received scholarships.


Note:
    1.	DO NOT USE connection parameters in python program directly.
    2.	In Step 4 and 5 DO NOT hard code table names in the queries.
    3.	Try to reuse as much functions as possible.
    4.	Create Classes and Methods within them based on the type of operation they do like below:
    a.	Snowflake_Class
    Methods: create_table(), insert_data(), get_data()
    b.	File_Operation_Class
    Methods: read_file(), write_file()
    c.	Helper_Class
    Methods: percent_calc(), get_conn_info()  and any other functions you need.
    5.	Use a single snowflake connection and cursor object for all the operations.
